# Tendermint DB

Data Base abstractions to be used in applications.
These abstractions are not only meant to be used in applications built on [Tendermint](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint), but can be used in a variety of applications.

By default when running `make test` tests for memdb & goleveldb are only run. 
If you would like to test all the available DBs please run `make test-all`
